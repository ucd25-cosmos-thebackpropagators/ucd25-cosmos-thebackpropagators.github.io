## Introduction

There are so many different genres of movies that we watch. Romance. Horror. Comedy. You name it. This project investigates similarities between features of a movie, such as genre, movie length, and popularity in order to group the large amount of movies into clusters that have similar characteristics. Using these similar characteristics, we can make conclusions about each group of movies based on how they were organized.
